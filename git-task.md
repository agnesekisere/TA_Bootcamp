## Introduction to Git and GitHub
 
**Git** is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on the same codebase simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. **GitHub** is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides tools for collaboration.

## Working with Branches
 
### Creating a New Branch
 
1.  **Open Terminal in VS Code**:
 
    -   Go to **"Terminal"** > **"New Terminal"**.
 
2.  **Check Current Branch**:
 
    `git branch`
 
    -   You should see `* master`.
 
3.  **Create and Switch to a New Branch**:
 
    `git checkout -b feature-branch`
 
    -   This creates a new branch called `feature-branch` and switches to it.
 
### Making Changes and Committing
 
1.  **Open README.md**:
 
    -   Locate and open `README.md` in VS Code.
 
2.  **Edit File**:
 
    -   Add a new line: `This is a change in the feature branch.`
 
3.  **Save the File**:
 
    -   Press `Ctrl+S` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+S` (macOS).
 
4.  **Stage the Changes**:
 
    -   In VS Code, go to the **Source Control** panel.
    -   You should see the modified `README.md`.
    -   Click the **"+"** icon next to the file to stage it.
 
5.  **Commit the Changes**:
 
    -   In the **Source Control** panel, enter a commit message like `Added a line in feature-branch`.
    -   Click the **"âœ”"** icon or press `Ctrl+Enter` to commit.

## Pushing Changes and Creating Pull Requests
 
1.  **Push the Branch to GitHub**:
 
    `git push -u origin feature-branch`
 
    -   This pushes your `feature-branch` to GitHub and sets the upstream branch.
 
2.  **Create a Pull Request**:
 
    -   Go to your repository on GitHub.
    -   You'll see a prompt: **"Compare & pull request"**. Click it.
    -   **Review the PR**:
        -   Check the base branch (`master`) and compare branch (`feature-branch`).
        -   Add a description if needed.
    -   **Create PR**: Click **"Create pull request"**.

## Merging Pull Requests
 
1.  **Review the PR**:
 
    -   Optionally, request a review or assign reviewers.
 
2.  **Merge the PR**:
 
    -   Click **"Merge pull request"**.
    -   Confirm by clicking **"Confirm merge"**.
 
3.  **Delete the Branch** (optional):
 
    -   Click **"Delete branch"** after merging.
 
4.  **Update Local Repository**:
 
    -   In VS Code terminal:
 
        `git checkout master git pull`
 
    -   This updates your local `master` branch with the latest changes.

## Creating and Resolving Merge Conflicts
 
### Creating Conflicting Changes
 
1.  **Create a New Branch**:
 
    `git checkout -b conflict-branch`
 
2.  **Edit README.md in conflict-branch**:
 
    -   Change a line to: `This line is edited in conflict-branch.`
 
3.  **Commit Changes**:
 
    -   Stage and commit the changes as before.
 
4.  **Push conflict-branch to GitHub**:
 
    `git push -u origin conflict-branch`
 
5.  **Switch to master and Create Conflicting Change**:
 
    `git checkout master`
 
6.  **Edit README.md in master**:
 
    -   Change the same line to: `This line is edited in master.`
 
7.  **Commit and Push Changes in master**:
 
    -   Stage and commit the changes.
 
    `git push`
 
### Attempt to Merge and Resolve Conflict
 
1.  **Switch back to conflict-branch**:
 
    `git checkout conflict-branch`
 
2.  **Merge master into conflict-branch**:
 
    `git merge master`
 
    -   Git will report a merge conflict.
 
3.  **Resolve the Conflict**:
 
    -   Open `README.md`.
    -   You'll see conflict markers like:
 
        `<<<<<<< HEAD This line is edited in conflict-branch. ======= This line is edited in master. >>>>>>> master`
 
    -   Decide which change to keep or combine them.
    -   For example:
        -   Keep both changes: `This line is edited in conflict-branch and master.`
 
4.  **Stage the Resolved File**:
 
    -   In the Source Control panel, stage `README.md`.
 
5.  **Complete the Merge Commit**:
 
    -   Commit the merge with a message like `Resolved merge conflict`.
 
6.  **Push the Resolved Branch**:
 
    `git push`
 
7.  **Create a Pull Request to Merge conflict-branch into master**:
 
    -   On GitHub, create a PR as before.
    -   Since conflicts are resolved, you can merge the PR.
